# Java_program_to_find_Equilibrium_index
Given an array A of n positive numbers. The task is to find the first Equilibrium Point in an array.  Equilibrium Point in an array is a position such that the sum of elements before it is equal to the sum of elements after it.

Input: 
n = 5 
A[] = {1,3,5,2,2} 
Output: 3 
Explanation:  
equilibrium point is at position 3 
as elements before it (1+3) = 
elements after it (2+2).
